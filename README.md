# Object-Detection-in-Images-using-Tensorflow-
**Steps:**<br>
1. Downloading the API from its source repository.
2. Installing dependencies
3. Creating the environment
4. Prepare EfficientDet Model. Loading the pre-trained model with weights from the TensorFlow Hub.
5. Preparing some Data for Inference
6. Reading the images
7. Sample of an image and its visualization
8. Visualization of all the images. The dataset holds 10 images
9. Inference â€“ Object Detection. Perform inference with the EfficientDet Model on the pre-processed image data.
10. Visualizing Object Detection Results
